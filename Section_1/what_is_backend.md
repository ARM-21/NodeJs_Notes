# Backend & Client-Server Architecture

## What is Backend?
Backend refers to the server-side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the browser. The backend is responsible for handling business logic, database operations, and the functioning of the application behind the scenes. It includes server, database, APIs, and any data processing tasks that the application needs to perform.

## What is Client-Server Architecture?
Client-Server Architecture is a model where multiple clients (frontend) interact with a single server (backend) to request and receive services. It is commonly used in web development where the client, typically a web browser, sends requests to the server, which processes them and sends back the appropriate responses, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, or data.

### What is a Server (Backend)?
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. The server handles incoming requests from clients, processes them, and sends back the appropriate responses. The server typically handles business logic, data storage, and other tasks that occur on the backend.

### What is a Client (Frontend)?
A client is a computer or software that requests services, resources, or data from a server over a network. It interacts with the server by sending requests and receiving responses, typically through a web browser, application, or other interface. The client usually presents data in a user-friendly way, often using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsible for the user experience.
