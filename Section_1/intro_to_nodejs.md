# What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a C++ application (CLI) that can understand and run JavaScript code outside of the browser. It provides a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling developers to execute JavaScript on the server side. This allows for building server-side applications with JavaScript, which was traditionally used only for client-side (browser) scripting.
