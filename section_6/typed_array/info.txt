typed array is a category of array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers.

The following are the typed array types:

Int8Array: 8-bit signed integer
Uint8Array: 8-bit unsigned integer
Uint8ClampedArray: 8-bit unsigned integer (clamped)

Int16Array: 16-bit signed integer
Uint16Array: 16-bit unsigned integer

Int32Array: 32-bit signed integer
Uint32Array: 32-bit unsigned integer

BigUint64Array: 64-bit unsigned integer
BigInt64Array: 64-bit signed integer


Float32Array: 32-bit floating point
Float64Array: 64-bit floating point



The typed array types are similar to the ArrayBuffer type, but they allow you to read and write data in a typed manner.
