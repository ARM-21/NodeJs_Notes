we cannpt direcctly read or write array buffer,
so we need to use new DataView() to read or write array buffer


##signed
maximun range is -128 to 127
getInt8() reads signed value from buffer
setInt8() writes signed value to buffer

##unsigned
maximun range is 0 to 255
maximum value than 255 will be 0 why? because it is unsigned value 
and it will start from 0 again after 255 
getUint8() reads unsigned value from buffer
setUint8() writes unsigned value to buffer
