## What is middleware?

middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

In simple words, middleware is a function that runs between the request and response of the server.

## there are 2 types of middleware:

1. Request handler middleware - 2 or 3 parameters (req,res,next)
2. Error handling middleware - 4 parameters (err,req,res,next)
   It executes in two conditions:
   2.1. whenever there is an error in the application
   2.2. whenever next() is called with a truthy value argument not falsy value('',false,0,null,undefined,NaN).
