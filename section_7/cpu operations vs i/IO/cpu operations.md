##cpu operations vs I/O operations
- CPU operations are faster than I/O operations.
- CPU operations are done in nanoseconds, while I/O operations are done in milliseconds.
- CPU operations are done in the CPU, while I/O operations are done in the I/O devices.



I/O operations are slower than CPU operations because they involve moving data between the CPU and I/O devices. This movement of data takes time, which makes I/O operations slower than CPU operations. In general, CPU operations are done in nanoseconds, while I/O operations are done in milliseconds. This is why I/O operations are slower than CPU operations.


##example of cpu operations are:
- Arithmetic operations
- Logical operations
- Bit manipulation operations
- Control operations
- Data transfer operations

note:- cpu operations blocks the main thread

##example of I/O operations are:
- Reading from a file
- Writing to a file
- Reading from a network socket
- Writing to a network socket
- Reading from a database
- Writing to a database
